GVExport
========

This is a repository for a webtrees module known as GVExport. GVExport's goal is to produce an "all in one tree" of every person in a family tree and their relationships. You can view the tree in webtrees and click on individuals of families to go to their page in webtrees, and produce output in multiple file formats such as JPG, SVG, PNG, PDF, and if Graphviz is installed on the server, others are possible.

One of the display options renders output like this:

Webtrees
--------

[Webtrees](https://webtrees.net/) is an online collaborative genealogy application. This can be hosted on your own server by following the [Install instructions](https://webtrees.net/install/). If you are familiar with Docker, you might like to install Webtrees using [this unofficial docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nathanvaughn/webtrees), [or this one](https://github.com/H2CK/webtrees).

Installation of GVExport
------------

To install GVExport, download the latest [release](https://github.com/Neriderc/GVExport/releases), copy files to modules_v4 directory in webtrees and rename the folder to GVExport. For more detail, see the [install instructions](https://github.com/Neriderc/GVExport/wiki/Installing-the-module).

GVExport Module

Older Versions
--------------

We attempt to keep up with the latest stable (non-prerelease) version of webtrees. You can see the latest release of webtrees [here](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/releases). Older versions are not supported. *However*, as we progress through webtrees versions, we are releasing GVExport versions. These are listed on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Neriderc/GVExport/releases). If you are not using the latest version of webtrees, and the latest release of GVExport isn't working for you, you may want to try an older release.

For versions earlier than 2.0.21 you can try the [source repository](https://github.com/tillsc/GVExport), but note this DOES NOT work with PHP 8 and it is missing many enhancements from this repository.

This repository
---------------
This repository was forked from [tillsc/GVExport](https://github.com/tillsc/GVExport) after community pull requests had not been merged for some time. [A post](https://www.webtrees.net/index.php/en/forum/4-customising/35801-display-complex-all-in-on-tree-with-gvexport) had been made on the webtrees forum stating that GVExport had been brought up to date to work with webtrees 2.0, but that the developer could not provide ongoing support. After a webtrees update broke the module, this fork was created to maintain compatibility and continue refining the tool with new features and other enhancements.
