## Reporting a Vulnerability

GVExport is a module for the webtrees software. If the vulnerability is in the webtrees software (i.e. it exists when GVExport is not installed), please see the [webtrees security policy](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/security/policy). 

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, instead please email the maintainer [Neriderc](mailto:e5e75e9a-9c32-4a27-bca3-b8ce84d6b758@simplelogin.com) or use the Security tab on GitHub to lodge a security disclosure. Please also advise if you would (or would not) like to receive attribution for the disclosure in the event it is accepted.

Expect acknowledgement within 24-48 hours. The speed of a fix will depend on the complexity of fixing the issue, but we intend to fix validated issues as soon as possible.
