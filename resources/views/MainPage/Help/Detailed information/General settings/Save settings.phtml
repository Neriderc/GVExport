Click a settings record to load it.</p><p>For example, you may have many diagrams you create from your tree. You may want to save the settings used for each diagram so that in future you can regenerate the diagram to include any new information.</p><p>If you click the ellipsis on a record, you will see several options. <ul><li>Delete - remove these settings</li><li>Download - download a file holding the settings, which can be loaded at a later date.</li><li>Copy link - if logged in, this allows you to share the settings with others by creating a URL to share with them, which is copied to the clipboard of your device.</li><li>Revoke link - if a sharing link has been created, this will show to allow you to revoke the link, so it can no longer be accessed.</li><li>Add to My favourites - If logged in, this will create a sharing link and add this to the webtrees favourites on your &quot;My page&quot; page.</li><li>Add to Tree favourites - If logged in as a tree manager, this will create a sharing link and add this to the webtrees favourites on the tree home page.</li></ul>When logged out, only the Delete and Download options will be available.</p><p>The &quot;Show saved diagrams panel&quot; option adds a new section to the settings that makes the saved settings available as a dropdown list. You may wish to use webtrees&apos; ability for an administrator to &quot;Masquerade as user&quot; to set up some settings for another user, then enable this option, so they can easily choose different prepared diagrams without needed to delve into the advanced settings.'); ?>
