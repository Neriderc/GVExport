When the option to display non-relatives in a different colour is selected, normally a scan is performed starting from the starting individuals and branching to all relatives regardless of display settings. This ensures that if a person is related via a link not displayed, they will still show as related.</p><p>Enabling this option prevents the full scan of the tree which can greatly speed up the generation of the diagram on larger trees, but may reduce accuracy of the colouring of non-relatives.'); ?>
