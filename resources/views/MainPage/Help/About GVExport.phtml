    <?= I18N::translate('GVExport is a webtrees module that allows you to create complex visual family trees, using a tool called Graphviz to display the tree. Select a starting person, adjust the settings, and see that person&apos;s family tree.</p><p>Some fields have an icon <span class=\"info-icon btn btn-primary\">i</span> next to them, clicking this will give you some more information about that field.</p><p>Advanced configurations are possible by toggling advanced settings by clicking the &quot;Toggle advanced settings&quot; option at the end of each section. Clicking the â›¶ in the top right corner of the browser rendering will display the browser rendering in full screen. Clicking the magnifying glass allows you to search the diagram for an individual.</p><p>You can also use the webtrees &quot;Clippings Cart&quot; feature to select records, which GVExport can then use instead of the &quot;People to be included&quot; settings.</p><p>There are several buttons that take action based on the settings that you have chosen:<ul><li>Update: Clicking this updates the browser render (this is hidden if auto-update is enabled).<li>Download: Clicking this will download the diagram in the format chosen in the &quot;Output file type&quot; option. <li>Reset: Clicking this will reset the settings to the default values.
