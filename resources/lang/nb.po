#. This is a message that is shown if the user both has Graphviz installed on the server AND has used the photo shape setting (e.g. to make photos circle). The photo shapes are not supported by Graphviz, and are manipulated into the diagram after Graphviz has generated it. This is not possible with server-rendered diagrams, so if this option is used we automatically use the browser generation and show this message.
