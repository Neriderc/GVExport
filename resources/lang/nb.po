msgid "This section allows for some changes to the content of tiles, including links, abbreviations, and the details included on individuals and families.</p><h4>Page links</h4><h5>Add URL to individuals and families</h5><p>For SVG (and PDF if Graphviz installed on server) output, links can be included. This way you can click on the person in the diagram to be taken to their webtrees page.</p><h4>Abbreviations</h4><h5>Abbreviated names</h5><p>There are several options to shorten the names of individuals displayed.</p><ul><li>Full name - the default option, this shows the primary name and any nickname. This option currently is the only one where the preferred name is underlined, and is the only one to show nicknames (in &quot;quotes&quot;).</li><li>Given and surnames - like the full name, but without nicknames.</li><li>Given names - just the given names are displayed.</li><li>First given names only - just the first word of the name in the given names field.</li><li>Surnames - just the surnames are displayed.</li><li>Initials only - this displays initials only, for example &quot;JFK&quot;.</li><li>Given name initials and surname - this shows initials for the first and second given name, as well as the full surname. For example: &quot;J.F. Kennedy&quot;</li><li>Don&apos;t show names - no names are shown. If birth and death details are also disabled then it is possible to show only photos or even just coloured boxes.</li></ul><h5>Abbreviated place names</h5><p>There are several options to shorten place names (for place of birth, place of marriage, place of death).</p><ul><li>Full place name - the place name is printed in full.</li><li>City and Country - the first and last section of the place name is used, using commas to split the sections. For example, &quot;London, England, United Kingdom&quot; would be shortened to &quot;London, United Kingdom&quot;</li><li>City and 2-Letter ISO Country Code - the first and last section of the place name is used, using commas to split the sections. The country is then converted to the ISO3166-1-Alpha-2 country code. <br>For example, &quot;Calgary, Alberta, Canada&quot; would be shortened to &quot;Calgary, CA&quot;</li><li>City and 3-Letter ISO Country Code - the first and last section of the place name is used, using commas to split the sections. The country is then converted to the ISO3166-1-Alpha-3 country code.<br>For example, &quot;Calgary, Alberta, Canada&quot; would be shortened to &quot;Calgary, CAN&quot;</li></ul><p>Note - The CLDR display name is used for matching. The data comes from <a href=\\\"https://www.datahub.io/core/country-codes\\\" class=\\\"help-link\\\">Datahub</a> but has been modified as for example the original CLDR name for the United Kingdom is &quot;UK&quot;, and the original CLDR name for the United States is &quot;US&quot;. Matching against these countries for the purposes of abbreviation is therefore pointless. So changes have been made to make this work better. Please <a href=\\\"https://github.com/Neriderc/GVExport/issues/new\\\" class=\\\"help-link\\\">open an issue</a> on GitHub if you find a country is not abbreviating correctly.</p><h4>Information on individuals</h4><h5>Show individual XREF</h5><p>Whether to include the XREF of individuals in the diagram.</p><h5>Show birthdate</h5><p>Check the box if you would like to include the birthdate of individuals in the output.</p><p>You can also choose whether to show the full date of birth or just the year.</p><h5>Show birthplace</h5><p>Whether to show the place of birth in the output.

Also see option for abbreviating place names.</p><h5>Show sex of individuals</h5><p>Whether to print the sex of the individual on the individual&apos;s tile, e.g. &quot;Male&quot;</p><h4>Information on families</h4><h5>Show family XREF</h5><p>Whether to include the XREF of families in the output.</p><h5>Show marriage date</h5><p>Check the box if you would like to include the date of marriage in the output.</p><p>You can also choose whether to show the full date of marriage or just the year.</p><h5>Show marriage place</h5><p>Whether to show the place of marriage in the output.

Smaller values will produce smaller files, but the quality will be worse and if the value is too low you may not be able to read text.</p><h4>Spacing</h4><p>These options affect the distance between nodes on the diagram.</p><h5>Between generations</h5><p>How close you want generations on the output. For example, for left to right output, smaller numbers will bring the columns of individuals closer together, while larger numbers would push them further apart.</p><h5>Between individuals on the same level</h5><p>How close you want the individuals of the same generation on the output. For example, for left to right output, smaller numbers will mean less space vertically between the boxes, while larger numbers would push them further apart.</p><h4>Diagram colours</h4><p>This section allows you to change colours associated with the diagram that are not directly related to the individual or family tiles. Click the coloured box to change the colour. This uses your browser&apos;s colour picker, so will look different depending on what browser you are using. <h5>Diagram background colour</h5><p>This is the colour of the area behind the family tree.</p><h5>Relationship arrow colour</h5><p>The colour of the arrows that show relationships between individuals and families.</p><h5>Show blood relationship in a different colour</h5><p>This shows blood relationships in a different colour than other relationships (e.g. adoption). Selecting this option will provide two colours that can be customised:<ul><li>Related by birth - the arrow colour to use for children related by birth</li><li>Related other than by birth - the arrow colour to use for children not related by birth</li></ul>"
